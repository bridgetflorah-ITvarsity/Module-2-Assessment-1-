                       <h3>coffe shop</h3>
                       <p>Cafe at Wild Things! is a Lincoln Park Zoo eatery located above the Wild Things! gift shop in the heart of the zoo. They have a pretty basic menu of sandwiches and salads, which they will bring to your table after you order it at the counter.</P>

                 <P>They focus on getting local, sustainably grown, and organic foods to use in their wraps, salads and paninis. I got a roast turkey sandwich, which had cranberry sauce, cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was pretty tasty. Others in my group got the same, and also their roast beef wrap.</P>

                 <P>They sell bottled water, sodas,coffe, milk and wine - and their bottled water is now in plastic-free bottles</P>
                      <p>Today's program:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Monday - Saturdayfrom 11:00am to 11:00pm</li>
                          <li>Sunday from 12:00am to 10:00pm</li>
                      
                      </ul>
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>The dining area is outdoors, under a large canopy, and since you are on the second floor, you have a nice view of the center of the zoo, including the seal/sea lion area.</p>
